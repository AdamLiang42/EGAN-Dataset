# SynResLoadPattern

Here we introduce the *`ERGAN-Dataset`*, which includes synthetic residential load patterns. These patterns closely emulate the temporal dependencies and distribution features present in genuine training data. It offers a broad and varied collection of load patterns, making it a prime resource for both researchers and practitioners. It's designed for in-depth analysis, simulation, and study in the field of residential electricity consumption.

## Data Description
The *`ERGAN-Dataset`* contains 1,000,000 generated residential load pattern profiles. Each profile represents normalized daily electricity consumption, at 1 hour resolution, with values spanning from 0 to 1.

## Data Construction

The dataset's residential load pattern profiles were synthesized using our proposed Ensemble Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (ERGAN) Framework, trained on a real-world dataset from the Pecan Street database. This data comprises hourly load data from 417 households over 2017. After normalization, the data was segmented into 10 distinct clusters using the K-Means clustering method, showcasing diverse consumption habits. 

With this clustering in place, the ERGAN framework was tasked to train 10 separate generative models, each corresponding to one of the 10 clusters. The final generated dataset aggregates the output from these 10 distinct generative models. It's crucial to note that the proportion of data in this aggregated dataset mirrors the proportion observed in the original clustered data. This method ensures a diverse and representative set of residential load patterns derived from the foundational Pecan Street database.

The above Fig.1 is the visual representation of these clusters emphasizes the varied load patterns, with each cluster capturing distinct consumption trends. This segmentation underscores the importance of individual generative models for each cluster to capture the intricate nuances of electricity consumption.

## Dataset Location
The dataset is located under the following directory: [ergan_dataset](https://github.com/AdamLiang42/ERGAN-Dataset/tree/main/ergan_dataset).

Inside the [ergan_dataset](https://github.com/AdamLiang42/ERGAN-Dataset/tree/main/ergan_dataset) directory, you will find two distinct folders:

1. **Individual Model Outputs ([clustered_dataset](https://github.com/AdamLiang42/ERGAN-Dataset/tree/main/ergan_dataset/clustered_dataset))**: This folder contains separate files, each storing data generated by a different model from the ERGAN ensemble framework.
2. **Aggregated Data ([aggregrated_dataset](https://github.com/AdamLiang42/ERGAN-Dataset/tree/main/ergan_dataset/aggregrated_dataset))**: Due to GitHub's file size limits, the aggregated data is split across multiple files. These files collectively contain the aggregation of data produced by all the models.

Please choose the appropriate folder based on whether you're interested in the outputs of individual models or the collective results.
